The guessing player will have 10 seconds to begin dictating both the song title and artist.
They can be said in any order and can also include filler words such as "by".
For example, if the correct answer is "Spice Up Your Life by the Spice Girls", both the guesses for "spice girls spice up your life" or "spice up your life by the spice girls" would be correct.
If the player guesses incorrectly or the time expires, an indicator for a wrong guess will appear on the scoreboard section.
If the player guesses correctly, an indicator for a correct guess will appear on the scoreboard section and that player will recieve 1 point.
